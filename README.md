# Welcome to the new version of Everling Browser

I am currently starting a project for fun. The concept is to create a collaborative browser using Tauri with Bun and React, written in TypeScript, which makes it easy to contribute.



[!IMPORTANT]

Please avoid mentioning that this is not a browser but merely a basic WebView or iFrame. I am aware of this fact, and frankly, I do not care as our objective is not to challenge commonly used browsers.
